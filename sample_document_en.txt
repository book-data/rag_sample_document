FY2024 Tech Solutions Inc. Management Strategy Plan

1. Introduction
Tech Solutions Inc. continues to prioritize technological innovation and customer satisfaction as its highest priorities, just as it did in the previous year.
The management policy for FY2024 aims to further strengthen efforts toward long-term growth and the development of a sustainable business model.
To date, our revenue has increased by 12% year-on-year, and our employee count has exceeded 1,200.
This document outlines the current status of each department, specific target figures for various initiatives, and key strategic measures for FY2024.

2. Changes in the Business Environment
The rapid advancement of digital technologies is drastically transforming the global business environment.
In particular, the cloud services market grew by 18% in FY2023 compared to the previous year. Our domestic market share also rose by 5%, reaching 15%.
However, competition is intensifying, especially against emerging companies.
For FY2024, we aim to expand our market share by an additional 5%.
Moreover, due to the increasing complexity of supply chains and the tightening of environmental regulations, the importance of sustainability and compliance is growing.
We plan to reduce CO₂ emissions from our supply chain by 20% year-on-year by the end of next fiscal year.

3. Departmental Analysis
3.1 Development Division
The Development Division is focusing on R&D of AI and blockchain technologies.
In FY2024, the internal project “Project Titan” has launched. Its goal is to develop three new AI algorithms and improve existing system performance by 15% within the fiscal year.
In particular, adopting the new TensorFlow 3.0 framework for data analysis tools is expected to boost processing speed by approximately 25% compared to the previous setup.
However, progress is currently behind schedule, with a delay of about two months and a budget overrun of more than 10%.
As such, proper reallocation of resources and optimization of working hours are crucial.

Productivity in the Development Division has improved, with the number of projects per person increasing from 6.2 to 7.8.
The average development period for AI-based products has also shortened by 3 months.
Next fiscal year, we aim to reduce that further by an average of 2 months and raise the number of projects per person to 8.5.

3.2 Sales Division
The number of new customer acquisitions decreased by 15% year-on-year, highlighting the urgent need to reassess the sales structure.
On the other hand, the contract renewal rate with existing clients rose from 80% to 85%, particularly due to stronger partnerships with major corporations.
Our goal is to raise the renewal rate to 90% next fiscal year.
For FY2024, we aim to acquire 200 new clients and reach a total of 1,000 contracts.
Sales revenue from this division is targeted to increase from 12 billion yen last year to 15 billion yen this year, with an average monthly growth rate of 5%.

To improve sales efficiency, the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system will be completely overhauled, aiming to reduce inquiry response time by 30%.
This is expected to improve customer satisfaction survey scores from 78 points last year to 85 this year.

3.3 Customer Support Division
To enhance customer satisfaction, faster responses and stronger problem-solving capabilities are urgently needed.
This year, we aim to automate 50% of customer inquiries through the implementation of AI chatbots.
This will increase daily support capacity from 3,000 to 4,500 cases.
Average response time will be reduced from 10 minutes to 5, and customer satisfaction is expected to rise from 70% to 90%.

We also plan to enhance staff skills by doubling the annual training hours per employee from 20 to 40.
With a stronger support structure, the number of repeat customers is expected to increase from 1,000 to 1,500 this fiscal year.

4. Key Initiatives
4.1 Accelerating Digital Transformation (DX)
We will further promote company-wide DX to enhance automation and efficiency.
Our goal is to reach 10 million annual users for our cloud services and improve sales by 10% through the adoption of big data analytics.
By automating internal processes, we aim to reduce annual work hours per employee by 200 hours, saving an estimated 100 million yen annually.

We also plan to introduce an AI-powered decision support system to speed up decision-making, aiming to reduce the time required to finalize key projects from 3 weeks to 1 week.
This system is expected to increase the project success rate from the current 85% to 95%.

4.2 Promoting Sustainability Strategy
In response to growing environmental accountability, we aim to reduce CO₂ emissions by 25% year-on-year by FY2024.
We plan to increase the use of renewable energy from 15% to 35% and raise the sales ratio of eco-friendly products from 5% to 10%.
We are committed to ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles and aim to improve our eco rating score from 70 to 90.

4.3 Talent Development and Diversity Promotion
To enhance global competitiveness, we believe in promoting innovation through diversity.
We aim to increase the proportion of female managers from 10% to 20% in FY2024.
In addition, we will double internal training programs, offering 80 hours of annual training per employee.

This is expected to increase overall productivity by 15% and reduce the turnover rate from 10% to 5%.

4.4 Strengthening Compliance and Risk Management
As we expand globally, regulatory compliance is increasingly important.
In FY2024, we will establish a Global Compliance Team to better respond to international regulations.
To address heightened requirements for privacy and data security, we will revise our company-wide data management protocols to fully comply with GDPR and other regulations.

Regarding risk management, we plan to enhance our response to pandemics and natural disasters.
We will enable remote work for 70% of employees and reduce office space usage from 80% to 50%.
We will also increase the frequency of BCP (Business Continuity Plan) training to strengthen emergency preparedness.
This is expected to shorten business downtime during emergencies from 24 hours to 12.

We will upgrade our cybersecurity systems to reduce the monthly number of security incidents from 5 to 2.
